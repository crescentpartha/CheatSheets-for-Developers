A Second Level Header

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.


Unordered List:

*   Gum.
*   Booze.

Ordered List:

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue  


List Item:

*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

*   Another item in the list.  

Link:

This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").
 

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

Not Case Sensitive:

I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

Reference Style:

Code:

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.


If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

    <blockquote>
        <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>



a = b
'`==`'

`a>b`
`"a>b"`

A new ordered List

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor  
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit  
    mi posuere lectus.  

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet   
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum    
    sit amet velit.  
  
2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.


A code block

*   A list item with a code block:

        <code goes here>

Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell  

Use the `printf()` function.  
A single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``  
A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``  
``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
