## Inheritance in Java

> Inheritance - It is the property of a child/derived/subclass, allowing it to inherit the properties() and functionalities or data members methods from its parent/base/superclass.  

___Java supports 4 types of inheritance:___

1.	Single Inheritance
2.	Multi-level Inheritance
3.	Hierarchical Inheritance
4.	Hybrid Inheritance 

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Single Inheritance: 

> As the title indicates, just one class is subject to this kind of inheritance. The parent class gives rise to just one child class. 

___Syntax:___

```java
Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your child class code
} 
```

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Multi-Level Inheritance:

> In multi-level inheritance, one class has more than one parent class but at different levels of inheritance.  

___Syntax:___

```java
Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your code
}
Class C extends B {
    //your code 
} 
```

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Hierarchical Inheritance

> In hierarchical inheritance, one parent can have one or more child/sub/derived classes.

___Syntax:___

```java
Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your child class code
}
Class C extends A {
    //your child class code 
}
```

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Hybrid Inheritance:

> Hybrid Inheritance is the combination of more than one type of inheritance in a single program. 

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## NOTE

> Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java as it leads to the diamond problem. <br /> We can achieve Multiple inheritance in Java by using the concept of Abstraction.

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Encapsulation in Java

> Encapsulation - It is wrapping of data members (variables) and functions (methods) together as a single unit. It is also known as **data hiding**, as variables of class is hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through methods of that class.

Encapsulation in Java can be achieved through packages

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Java Packages

> A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. It provides access protection and prevents naming collision. 

```java
package mypack;
public class Demo{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Â­ _statements_  
	}
}
```
**To Compile:** javac -d . Demo.java
**To Run:** java mypack.Demo
**Accessing package from another package:** import package.* or import package.className.*

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Abstraction in Java

> Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

___Abstraction can be achieved in 2 ways in Java___

1.	Abstract class
2. Interface

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Abstract class

> Class declared with abstract keyword, which cannot be instatiated and has to be extended by other classes for its methods to be implemented. It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

```java
    abstract class A{  
      abstract void demo();  
    }  
	//Abstract class extended by other class to implement its methods
	class B extends A{
		void demo(){
			_statements_  
		}
	}
```
**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Interface 

> Interface is blueprint of class having public abstract methods and public static final constants. It cannot be instatiated. Interface is extended by other interfaces and implemented by class.

```java
interface Printable{
	void print(); //empty method body
}
class Demo implements Printable{
	public void print(){
		_statements_
	}
}
```
**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Polymorphism in Java

> Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform single action in different ways. It is of two types: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and run-time polymorphism (method overriding).

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Method overloading

> It is compile-time polymorphism. If a class has multiple methods having same name but different parameters, it is known as Method Overloading. Parameters can differ in number of arguments or data type of arguments.

```java
class Demo{
	int add(int a, int b){return a+b;}
	double add(double a, double b, double c){return a+b+c;}
}
```

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Method overriding

> It is run-time polymorphism. If a child class provides specific implementation of method declared in parent class, it is known as method overriding.

```java
class Vehicle{
	void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running")};
}
class Car{
	void run(){System.out.println("Car is running")};
}
```

## Collections

|Collection|Description|
|-----|-----|
|Set| Set is a collection of elements which can not contain duplicate values. Set is implemented in HashSets, LinkedHashSets, TreeSet etc|
|List| List is a ordered collection of elements which can have duplicates. Lists are classified into ArrayList, LinkedList, Vectors|
|Queue| FIFO approach, while instantiating Queue interface you can either choose LinkedList or PriorityQueue.|
|Stack| LIFO approach, stack is a sub ordinate of vector which helps in performing different functions.|
|Deque| Deque(Double Ended Queue) is used to add or remove elements from both the ends of the Queue(both head and tail)|
|Map| Map contains key-values pairs which don't have any duplicates. Map is implemented in HashMap, TreeMap etc.|
